**_Tile_** - A single square unit which comprises the puzzle board that can be broken, filled, or flagged.

**_Break_** - A mechanic that allows the player to indicate that a tile(s) is part of the image.

**_Fill_** - A mechanic that allows the player to indicate that a tile(s) is not part of the image. When the game beings, all tiles start "filled".

**_Flag_** - A mechanic that allows the player to mark a tile. A marked tile indicates that a tile is not part of the image, and should not be broken.

**_Guiding Number(s)_** - number(s) written on the sides of the puzzle board, which provide clues to the player on how many tiles in a row or column should be broken and how they should be arranged.
